# Sequelize REST server

## Starter Pack

Simply define your models and some fake data rules, and the rest will just work:

- Automatic generation of fake data (based on the rules you set)
- REST API for CRUD operations on all models
- Admin panel with UI
- Help files listing the methods and data fields of each Sequelize type
- An SVG chart of the models and their relations

---

- define your models in **db/models.js** in the **getModels and connectModels** methods
- define your fake data rules in **db/models.js** in the **getFakeDataRules** method
